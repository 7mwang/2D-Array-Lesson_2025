    "## Needed Knowledge:\n",
    "- **Nested iteration** refers to statements that iterate over elements in a 2D array.\n",
    "- **2D arrays** are arrays of arrays and are traversed using for loops, similar to enhanced for loops for 1D arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concept:\n",
    "- Nested iteration statements can be written to traverse the 2D array in **row-major order** or **column-major order**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traversing with Nested Enhanced For Loops:\n",
    "- The **outer loop** in a nested enhanced for loop traverses the rows.\n",
    "- The enhanced for loop variable must be a 1D array type since the row itself is a 1D array.\n",
    "- The **inner loop** traverses a single row, and the inner enhanced for loop variable must be the same type as the elements in the 1D array.\n",
