    "Relational Operators in Python are used to create a relationship between two entities usuually using comparisons such as involving comparisons such as equality, inequality, greater than, and less than. The operators then evaluvate the relationship between the entities and give an ouput of either True or False for the relationship.\n",

    "1. Equal To: ==  (This opertor means equal to and is true if both operands are equal) Ex: a == b\n",

    "3. Greater Than: > (This operator is true if the operand on the left is greater than the operand on the right) Ex: a > b\n",
