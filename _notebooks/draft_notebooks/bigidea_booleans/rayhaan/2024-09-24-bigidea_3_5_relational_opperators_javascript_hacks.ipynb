    "## De Morgan's Law\n",
    "\n",
    "Using De Morgan's Law you can simplify the following, \n",
    "\n",
    "!(A && B) === (!A || !B) \n",
    "\n",
    "!(A || B) === (!A && !B)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "Without De Morgan's Law: \n",
    "if (!(a || b)) {\n",
    "    \n",
    "}\n",
    " - Confusing to read and understand\n",
    "\n",
    "Using De Morgan's Law:\n",
    "if (!a && !b){\n",
    "    \n",
    "}\n",
    "- Simplified, easy to read and understand\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "De Morgan's Law allows further simplification of logical expressions involving And(&&), Or(||), and Not(!). This allows code to be simplified making it easier to read and understand.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Requirements: \n",
    " - Must have at least 10 differnt questions\n",
