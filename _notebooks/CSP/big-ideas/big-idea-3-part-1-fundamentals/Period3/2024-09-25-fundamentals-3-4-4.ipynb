    "### Making Strings\n",
    "When it comes to making strings, there are ways of going about it--- Each method requiring that one surrounds the text they want to make a string with these characters. These methods are listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Single Quotes ('...')\n",
    "Double Quotes (\"...\")\n",
    "Backticks     (`...`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Single Quotes and Double Quotes are the most conventionally used and serve the same purpose. Surrounding text as to delinate them as strings and not another data type. So most of the time, you'll be using either single or double quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the last option, strings that use backticks (known as template strings), are also very important to know and a proficient coder in Javascript will take advantage of this type of string when the opportunity arises. We'll come back to this string later, but what you should know now is that it allows you to implant javascript code that isn't inherentely a string into your string, such as a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To confirm whether a variable is a string or not, you can put the potential string inside typeof().\n"
