    "- Making a submenu\n",
    "- Using the submenu headings to Guide topics\n",
    "- Make your own customized pages for elements on the submenu\n",
    "- Make a page that has dynamic actions through JavaScript\n",
    "- Review and experiment with the usage of Styles in GitHub Pages\n",
    "- Create some simple data tracking in Code\n",
    "- Start the process of debugging\n",

    "Learning how to identify files in GitHub Pages is a key skill.  This class will continually share files and have challenges using GitHup Pages and Jupyter Notebooks.  Even thought you will be working as a pair, you will need to share files with your partner.\n",
    "- To copy files between repostories, open two vscode windows and you can drag and drop\n",
    "- The _includes directory is the default location to place files that you want to share across many notebooks.  The submenu will be in this directory.\n",
    "  - Copy the file _includes/nav/github_pages.html into the _includes folder of your student repository.  \n",
    "  - This creates the navigation links between the different pages in this mini project\n",
    "- The _notebooks directory is the default location to place all .ipynb files.  These are interactive notebooks in VSCode and are converted to Web Pages through GitHub Pages Actions.\n",
