    "## GitHub Pages Coding Introduction \n",
    "Building the entire frontend GitHub Pages web application requires knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. GitHub Pages has built-in support for an additional content language called Markdown, which is a shorthand complement to HTML. Markdown is focused on creating static content.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HTML** is responsible for the content\n",
    "- **Markdown** is a shorthand way of writing content\n",
    "- **CSS** adds styling to the web page content\n",
    "- **JavaScript** adds functionality and interactivity\n",
    "\n",
    "In GitHub Pages, Jekyll serves as the build framework. It takes our choice of theme specified in the `_config.yml` file, along with our Markdown, HTML, and notebook files, to construct a complete static website. A significant portion of the frontend design work has already been done for users through the selection and use of a theme; this greatly reduces the need to code in CSS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jekyll converts Markdown (.md) files into HTML. Behind the scenes of GitHub Pages, Jekyll and the Liquid programming language build and programmatically construct each Markdown file into a specific web page. Markdown provides a straightforward way to start with GitHub Pages development. **In a Markdown file, you can exclusively use Markdown syntax or incorporate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** based on your expertise and experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Static Content?\n",
    "Static content refers to web pages that are delivered to the user's browser exactly as stored, without any server-side processing or dynamic content generation. This means the content remains the same for every user and does not change unless the source files are manually updated. Static websites are typically faster, more secure, and easier to deploy compared to dynamic websites, which require server-side processing to generate content on-the-fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding Dynamics to GitHub Pages\n",
    "Through the use of JavaScript and the fetch of data through APIs (backed by servers), developers are able to customize GitHub Pages to support data change. As we explore the portfolio_2025, we will see JavaScript games, login systems, and data that appear very dynamic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nighthawk Pages\n",
    "While this introduction covers the basics of creating static content with GitHub Pages, our classroom GitHub Pages will delve deeper into more advanced topics. We will explore how to integrate dynamic content, use advanced JavaScript techniques, and leverage APIs to create more interactive and engaging web pages.\n",
