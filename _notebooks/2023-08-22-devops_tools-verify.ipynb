      "Nighthawk Pages is a project designed to support students in their Computer Science and Software Engineering education. It offers a wide range of resources including tech talks, code examples, and educational blogs. This project was initially based on Fastpages but has since evolved into an independent entity, it is no longer following Fastpages' updates. The decision to separate from Fastpages was influenced by the deprecation of Fastpages in favor of Quarto, and the subsequent changes in development features that did not align with our goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Features\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Code Examples**: Provides practical coding examples in JavaScript, including a platformer game, and frontend code for user databases using Python and Java backends.\n",
      "- **Educational Blogs**: Offers instructional content on various topics such as developer tools setup, deployment on AWS, SQL databases, machine learning, and data structures. It utilizes Jupyter Notebooks for interactive lessons and coding challenges.\n",
      "- **Tools and Integrations**: Features GitHub actions for blog publishing, Utterances for blog commenting, local development support via Makefile and scripts, and styling with the Minima Theme and SASS. It also includes a new integration with GitHub Projects for planning purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Contributions\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Notable Contributions**: Highlights significant contributions to the project, including theme development, search and tagging functionality, GitHub API integration, and the incorporation of GitHub Projects into GitHub pages. Contributors such as Tirth Thakker, Mirza Beg, and Toby Ledder have played crucial roles in these developments.\n",
      "\n",
      "## GitHub Pages setup\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Activating GitHub Pages Actions\n",
      "1. **Activate GitHub Pages Actions**: This step involves enabling GitHub Pages Actions for your project. By doing so, your project will be automatically deployed using GitHub Pages Actions, ensuring that your project is always up to date with the latest changes you push to your repository.\n",
      "\n",
      "- On the GitHub website for the repository go to menu: Settings -> Pages ->  Build and Deployment and select \"GitHub Actions\". \n",
      "\n",
      "#### Configuring the `_config.yml`\n",
      "2. **Update `_config.yml`**: You need to modify the `_config.yml` file to reflect your repository's name. This configuration is crucial because it ensures that your project's styling is correctly applied, making your deployed site look as intended rather than unstyled or broken.\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "github_repo: \"portfolio_2025\" \n",
      "baseurl: \"/portfolio_2025\"\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Updating the Makefile\n",
      "3. **Set Repository Name in Makefile**: Adjust the `REPO_NAME` variable in your Makefile to match your GitHub repository's name. This action facilitates the automatic updating of posts and notebooks on your local development server, improving the development process.\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "# Configuration, override port with usage: make PORT=4200\n",
      "PORT ?= 4100\n",
      "REPO_NAME ?= portfolio_2025\n",
      "LOG_FILE = /tmp/jekyll$(PORT).log\n",

      "## GitHub Pages setup\n",
      "The absolutes in setup up...\n",
      "1. Activate GitHub Pages Actions.   The benefit, your project will be deployed via GitHub Pages Actions.\n",
      "2. Configure the _config.yml to match the name of the repository. The benefit, your project style will be activated and your project won't look awful when deployed.\n",
      "3. Set your repository name in your Makefile.  The benefit, your project will automatically update posts and notebooks to your localhost server during development.\n",

This allows for easily finding pages and information that you are looking for.

The way to add images to a page is to have the following front matter `image: /images/file.jpg` and then the name of the image that you want to use. The image must be in the `images` folder. Furthermore, if you would like the file to not show up on the blog page `hide: true` can be added to the front matter.\n",

      "\n",
      "- NIGHTHAWK-Pages supports a variety of different themes that are each overlaid on top of minima. To use each theme, go to the \"custom-styles.scss\" file and simply uncomment the theme you want to use. To toggle the theme off, comment in front of the line that imports the theme in the file. To add your themes, find the desired theme’s GitHub repository and make a new folder in the sass directory that’s named the name of your theme. Copy the import statement format from the other styles on \"custom-styles.scss\", add your import statement, and you're done. Note that adding personal themes may cause things to break and a given theme’s compatibility with NIGHTHAWK-Pages may be suboptimal. To add a personal styling twist, add your unique .scss file to \"custom-styles\" via import. Here is an example import `@import \"minima/NIGHTHAWK-Pages-styles\";`. Note that you can also add your own SCSS in the file itself in the area labeled specifically for that purpose. Also, you can mix different styles by combining them together in NIGHTHAWK-Pages however the effects may vary.\n",

If you want to add one of these common elements, use liquid syntax to import the desired element to your file. Here’s an example of the liquid syntax used to import: `{%- include post_list.html -%}` Note that the liquid syntax is surrounded by curly braces and percent signs.
