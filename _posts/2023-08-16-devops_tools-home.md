## Quick Start to Development Tools
Embrace the essentials of development with a focus on practical tools and environments. This intro highlights the core components you'll need for a smooth entry into coding, collaboration, and project management.

A Computer, Git, and a Code Editor are the starting points for rapid entry into <mark>Code/Code/Coding</mark>.  Add Jupyter Notebooks (computational documents) and you bridge a Computer with Data Science.  The beauty of Jupyter Notebooks is that it provides a computational narrative, a document that allows code and data with visual analysis, hypothesis, and conjecture.

## Essentials
- Laptop Requirement: Ensure you have a laptop with development tools installed. MacOS, Windows, or Linux are preferred. Chromebooks can be supported using a KASM cloud desktop.
- Version Control with GitHub: Set up a personal GitHub account for code sharing and collaboration. It will become your coding portfolio and collaboration hub.
- Code Editor: Use Visual Studio Code for its extensive support for programming languages and helpful coding features.
- Web Hosting with GitHub Pages: Publish your projects and notes, showcasing your development journey.
- Interactive Coding with Jupyter Notebooks: Ideal for coding, data analysis, and documentation in an interactive environment.
- Communication via Slack: Stay updated and connected with class announcements and discussions.
- Application Containerization with Docker: Learn to create, deploy, and run applications with ease using Docker.

## Obtain Tool and Setup Depth
- MacOS Tools. The Homebrew `brew` command for MacOS developer tools installation. 
- Windows Tools. The `wsl` command line for WSL setup.  The `apt` command for Ubuntu developer tools installation.
- Visual Studio Code marketplace.  Become familiar with key extensions to improve your coding.
- Python Packages. Learn the `pip` command for Python library additions.
- Java Packages. Learn the pom.xml configuration for Java library additions.

## Engagement and Participation
- Active Participation: Bringing your laptop daily is crucial. Lack of access to necessary tools equates to absence.
- Understanding Tools: Start to engage with the tools through this activity.  Talk about what you learn as you use your tools, then share newly learned elements with 
others. Familiarity and sharing will breed efficiency in coding.
- Community and Support: Register in the Users Database for tailored support and to enable automation for class activities. Also, be a communicator on Slack with fellow students and teachers.
